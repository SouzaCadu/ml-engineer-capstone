# Capstone project
Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

# Project Overview
In this project, we analyze data on traffic accidents that occurred on Brazilian federal roads from 2017 to 2019. Public data collected by agents responsible for monitoring Brazilian roads will be used. The data will be pre-processed so that it becomes suitable for analysis. An exploratory analysis will be carried out to understand how accidents that happen on Brazilian roads are. Finally, a model will be developed to predict accidents with victims, fatal or not.

# Software and Libraries
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE using Amazon SageMaker. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

* NumPy
* Pandas
Sklearn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Seaborn (for data visualization)
joblib (use to save sklearn models)
missingno (to analyze missing data)
tqdm (to show progress bars)
Word2vec (to analyze categorical features)
k-means (to unsupervised learn)
imblearn (for resampling imbalanced data)
xgboost (for the supervised model)

How the project is organized
There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks that are supposed to be ran in order

Data Cleaning and EDA.ipynb
Accident prediction.ipynb

# Data
The source for this project is Policia Rodovi√°ria Federal website. The data are acessed through https://portal.prf.gov.br/dados-abertos
